### v1.1 - 10/Dec/2016
* Added `pkgmeta.yaml` so we have a nice markdown set of notes
* Added `CHANGELOG.md` which contains said notes
* Adjusted the Order Hall / Garrison button to sit above the clock in the center
  * This is because it was interferring with the queue icon in the bottom left corner
