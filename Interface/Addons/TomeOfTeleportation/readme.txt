Tome of Teleportation
---------------------

Tome of Teleportation organises all of your teleporting spells and items into
a single window.  If the item needs to be equipped then it will automatically
be unequipped after you have teleported. The Tome also lets you create macros
to use the spells.  Just type /tele to open the Tome, or click on the icon next
to the minimap.

The buttons in the Tome of Teleportation will each be one of three colours:
* Green: You can cast this spell now.
* Yellow: This spell is on cooldown. The cooldown remaining is displayed on 
  the button.
* Red: This item is cast using an item that must be equipped. Click on the 
  button once to equip it.  If this doesn't start a cooldown, then click again
  to teleport.  Once the summon is successful or you close the Tome the item
  will be unequipped.
  
You can create a macro for a teleportation item by Ctrl + clicking the button.
The macro will be placed on your cursor and it can be dragged onto an action 
bar. This macro acts like the buttons in the Tome, with the first click 
equipping the item and the second click using it.

Right clicking the minimap icon will bring up a quick list of your favourite
spells. To add a spell to this list right click on it in the main window.
Equippable items can not be added to this menu.

Adding New Items or Spells
--------------------------

Right click on the main window then select "Customize Spells". This will let you add 
spells and items. To do this, you need to go to wowhead.com and get the spell or item
id. For example, "Teleport: Moonglade" is at http://www.wowhead.com/spell=18960/teleport-moonglade
which tells you the spell id is 18960.

Customize Spells also lets you change the sort order with the up and down arrows, hide
spells with the eye icon, and delete custom spells with the skull icon. The sort order
will only be used if you right click the window and select Sort->Custom.

Advanced Options
----------------

The /tele command can be used for advanced options. The following commands are 
available:

/tele move x y
Move the window to the specified location. For example "/tele move 100 200".

/tele reset
Move the window back to the centre of the screen. Useful if the window is moved 
off the edge of the screen.

/tele showicon
Show the minimap icon.

/tele hideicon
Show the minimap icon.

Known Issues
------------

It is not possible to open or close Tome of Teleportation while in combat due 
to restrictions in the way addons work.
